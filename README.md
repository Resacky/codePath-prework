Joseph's memory game: is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Joseph Ruiz

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I have recieved guidance and advice from my mentor who has been teaching me programming/coding for months now.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I have personally struggled with figuring out how the HTML and JavaScript interact with each other and modify HTML text within JavaScript coding, I overcame it by reading the Java Script documentation which I found within searching on google. I struggled with figuring out how to interact and optimize the timer correctly so its properly integrated within the website, and I overcame it by, reading the proper documentation for the functions the instructions provided and understood how they worked by testing them out before implementing them to my code, this also taught me how functions can be passed in as arguments and can be stored into a variable. I was challenged with how to represent the timer and figuring out the mathematics behind it, I ended up using an int clock variable which increments by one per time the function is called and thus sub  variables that use the modulo and the division operand to calculate the minutes and seconds.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How people optimize websites to have fancy transitions and how they manage to create efficient code where it is seemless, and how people can use web programming languages to interact with databases. How to properly add videos to websites and have them encoded within the site, how to import external libraries and 3rd party assets to use to make the website cleaner and have more optimized preferences. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I wanted to add more unique sounds and pictures but unfortunately glitch.com was having issues with importing assets properly. Another feature I wanted to add was to have the user input so the user can decide how many blocks there are and a challenge feature for the user to set a timer on how fast they can finish the game, alongside with a leaderboard that records the time of every user that accesses the website and plays and asks for the users name after they win. And to refine the structure of my code and refactor how it looks so its more presentable.
